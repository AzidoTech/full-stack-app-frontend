        KONG Puppy toy is customized for a growing puppy’s baby teeth, the
        unique, natural rubber formula is the most gentle within the KONG rubber
        toy line. Designed to meet the needs of a puppy’s 28-baby teeth, it
        helps teach appropriate chewing behavior while offering enrichment and
        satisfying a younger pup’s instinctual needs. Meanwhile, the erratic
        bounces make it ideal for those pups that just want to play. A stuffed
        Puppy KONG occupies busy little ones while allowing pet parents the
        freedom to attend to their unique needs. Want to make crate training
        easier or extend play time? Be sure to stuff with puppy kibble and a
        dash of peanut butter. Add to the fun by including KONG Puppy Snacks and
        top with KONG Puppy Easy Treat.
